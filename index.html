            <h1>Freedom of Expression</h1>

        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Some of the clearest moments of expression in my life have been
                quiet ones. They've happened late at night, sitting in front of
                a screen, rewriting the same few lines of code—not because they
                were broken, but because something about them didn't feel right.
                I've learned to trust that feeling. It's usually my reminder
                that what I'm building belongs to a collective experience and
                carries consequences beyond me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I express myself most honestly through building. When I code or
                design systems, I'm not just solving problems; I'm thinking
                about people—who will use this, who might struggle with it, and
                who might be left out entirely. Each project becomes a small act
                of translation, turning care into structure and intention into
                design. That instinct is rooted in a principle I've carried with
                me for years: to love your neighbor as yourself—not as an
                abstract idea, but as a daily responsibility and a form of
                stewardship over the systems we share.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reflection is the other place my voice shows up. I notice how
                environments shape behavior—how a classroom feels safer when
                someone listens, or how a single word can invite participation
                or quietly shut it down. These observations stay with me,
                guiding how I lead, collaborate, and take on the mantle of
                responsibility when building with and for others.
            </p>
            <p>
                Freedom of expression, to me, isn't about being the loudest
                voice in the room. It's about having the freedom to pause, to
                revise, and to grow without losing honesty. It's about choosing
                responsibility over convenience and curiosity over certainty,
                especially when what we build affects more than ourselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm drawn to communities that understand expression this way—not
                as performance, but as presence. Places where individuality is
                trusted and the collective good is taken seriously. That's where
                I feel most myself: building carefully, listening closely, and
                carrying the mantle of stewardship with humility and care.
            </p>
